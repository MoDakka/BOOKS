   <FONT SIZE="3">The necromancer shares many attributes in common with <A HREF="../PHB/DD01472.htm">unspecialized
    mages</A> as described in the <I>PHB</I>. As with all characters, 
   the DM must first establish the specialist&#146;s ability scores, 
   race, experience, spell abilities, and proficiencies. These game 
   statistics provide the most basic &#147;skeletal&#148; outline of the 
   wizard, which will be expanded throughout this book.</FONT></P>
