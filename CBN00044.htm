</FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> Three times per day, the necromancer can cause skeletons and zombies of
humans, demihumans, or humanoids to arise with but a mere touch. These mindless
undead can serve the necromancer during the same round in which they were animated.
Two skeletons or one zombie can be animated per level of the wizard. The
remains of larger creatures can be animated, though they only fight as if they
possessed 2 hit dice. In most other respects, this power functions similar to the
5th-level spell <I>animate dead</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="1">.
